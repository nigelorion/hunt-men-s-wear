          Harvey Gorsuch, Owner/Founder of HUNT, began developing his style over sixty-four years ago as a ten year old living  in Ferndale, Washington. After spending a summer picking strawberries, he spent his entire wages ($23.00) on three sets of underwear, socks, and an orange and white vertical striped shirt at Kean’s Department Store.

          This early appreciation for an intentional investment associated with the development of a personal clothing style eventually led to Harvey’s frequent trips during the 70’s and 80’s from his home in Bellingham to a men’s thrift store in Seattle on Madison Avenue. His enthusiasm for menswear resale set him on the path to opening up his own shop.

          In December of 2016, Harvey opened HUNT Gentlemen’s Resale on Edmunds Street in the vibrant neighborhood of Columbia City. HUNT has since become a destination shop in the evolving style scene of Seattle. Located in the Shirley Marvin Hotel Annex, HUNT is a “tiny house” boutique with a cozy arrangement of high end goods.

            Personal Wardrobe Stylist Hilary Bailey Burnett
            took her skills to HUNT in August of 2016. As a personal wardrobe stylist, Hilary helps clients find their best selves through the power of style. Her philosophy, "Have less, be chic, shop well", is a guiding principle of the HUNT ethos.  She coaches customers to purchase pieces that will be workhorses in their wardrobes.  Hilary believes that "personal style is an accessible luxury.  Crafting a wardrobe that elevates daily living is a worthy pursuit".

            Harvey and Hilary are purveyors of "luxury for less".  Their passion for curating a bountiful inventory for HUNT will make you a return customer.
